# Student Management System - Mini Project
Student Management System is based on the concept of managing student information. User can manage student information by adding, removing, viewing and getting deleted records. The system creates an external file to store the userâ€™s data permanently. Deleted records also are saved in another separate external file. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential ones.
